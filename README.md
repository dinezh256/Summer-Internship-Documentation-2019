# Summer-Internship-Documentation-2019

● Worked in the ROS environment. The turtlebot gave up after few days.


● So I along with my guide started developing an autonomous robotic platform which has intended application in agriculture. We reached till the navigation part. 


● Explored the usage of Nvidia Jetson board, IMU sensors, etc.


● Parallely was also developing a module which displays the current temperature and humidity using a DHT22 sensor and NodeMCU Development Board through a web server.


● Learnt the use of AJAX script to refresh only the Temperature and Humidity data in the webpage.
